    applies. Elements already inside the collection were validated when they

    base; only variable-size collections offer append and pop. Fixed-length
    shapes accept element assignment but reject any length change. Mutability
    itself is configurable through the inherited MUTABLE flag.

    The type parameter is the declared element type: sequences bind their own
    element type, bitfields bind Boolean, and byte lists bind int. Mutation is
    typed against it, so type checkers flag raw values at mutation sites even
